## Downsize A Video

Halve video resolution of all MP4s of the `source` directory.

The output MP4s can be up to 30 times smaller (not really sure of the chopping algorithm below). But it does the job...
 
**Run the script**
```bash
bash transform-av/downsize/run -s target_directory
# e.g.
bash transform-av/downsize/run -s ../../Desktop
```
